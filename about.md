Hi, my name is Ray. I've been working as front-end developer since 2012. I like to build simple and intuitive applications. And here is what I value the most: 
- Maintainable, robust code
- Fast, response user interface
- Intuitive, practical features

Currently, I work as a senior software engineer at [Omny Studio](https://omnystudio.com/learn) building web application that manges podcast hosting and advertising mainly with React, TypeScript, Graphql and Node.js.
